### Rod magnets inscribed in an elastic cuboid: interpreting single-domain ferroics in Onsager's spirit

[Note](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01811) on a toy model for ferroic orders through entropy. As the rod/spin concentration (or the volume enclosing the ferroic rods) is variable by a tunable force conjugate to the order parameter, the model exhibits hysteresis associated to some discontinuous isotropic-nematic transitions explained essentially by Onsager's hard-rod model. The uniaxial anisotropy and nonperiodicity by construction is reminiscent of Stoner-Wohlfarth's single-domain magnet, and the toy model may ultimately be seen as a minimalistic for hard ferroics with some possible self-averaging disorders. Spin togglings shall be reliable due to the clean two-well energy landscapes in the athermal transition theory.

### Conformal Transformations in Riemannian Geometry
In this essay, we show our readers the transformations of the Christoffel symbols, Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, Ricci scalar, Einstein tensor, as well as the invariance of the Weyl tensor, in response to a conformal transformation of the metric tensor. One can find all the detailed computations in [Conformal Transformations in Riemannian Geometry](../assets/notes/Conformal Transformations in Riemannian Geometry.pdf).
